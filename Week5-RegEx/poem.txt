 by Manuel Gutiérrez Nájera

I want to die as the day declines,
at high sea and 04/22/1987 facing the sky,
while agony seems like a dream
and my soul like a bird that can fly.

To hear not, at this last moment,
once alone with sky and sea, 1987-04-22
any more voices nor weeping prayers
than the majestic beating of the waves.

To die when the sad light retires
its golden 22/04/1987 network from the green waves
to be like the sun that slowly expires;
something very luminous that fades.

To die, and die young, before
fleeting time removes the gentle crown,
while life still says: "I'm yours"
though we know with our hearts that she lies.
